                    <li><strong>Principal:</strong> The initial amount of the loan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add-on Rate:</strong> The interest rate applied to the loan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tenor:</strong> The duration of the loan in months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Documentary Stamp Fee:</strong> The fee for the documentary stamp.</li>
