## Why I Created This

I created this project to practice creating APIs using FastAPI.

## Why FastAPI?

I chose FastAPI because it is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is fast, easy to use, and has great documentation.

## Why I didn't use Django or Flask?

I didn't use Django because it is a full-stack web framework that is too heavy for this simple project. I didn't use Flask because I wanted to try something new.

## Why I didn't use Vue.js or React?

I didn't use Vue.js or React because I wanted to focus on the backend for this project.
